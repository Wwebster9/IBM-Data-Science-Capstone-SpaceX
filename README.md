## SpaceX  Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

In this capstone project part of the IBM Data Science professional certificate, we predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. This is done using data collected through the SpaceX API and web scraping, with the use of machine learning models to predict whether the first stage of the rocket can be reused.
